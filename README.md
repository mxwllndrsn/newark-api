Newark API
============

#### Node/Express interface for component search 

[Newark Documentation](https://partner.element14.com/docs/Product_Search_API_REST__Description#storeinfo)

*Enabling automated component data retrieval for purchasing and engineering applications*

Should be developed as interface for general search request component ie:

  - Digi-Key Interface ---> Search Component
  - Newark Interface ---> Search Component

Rendering to shared results view _in progress_.

_Due to Newark API requirements you will require your own API key -- save as 'key.txt' in top directory. (You can obtain [a key here](https://partner.element14.com))_
